The sample SVG is an adaptation of [the W3C's official SVG logo](http://www.w3.org/2009/08/svg-logos.html); it is licenced CC-BY-NC-SA 2.5 so give credit, don't sell it, and if you adapt it then re-share it.

I plan to adapt the slide layout HTML/CSS/JS into a separate utility that I'll release as its own repo.  If you want to do something with them before I get around to doing that, just send me a note.
